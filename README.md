Introduction:
This project was made to showcase my abilities writing SQL queries. I sourced the data from Kaggle and used the sqlite3 python module to query the data in jupyterlabs. I start by doing basic viewing of the data to see its features and use matplotlib to create a histogram for some basic exploratory analysis on players' home countries. The final half of the project focuses on answering the question: "Was there a significant difference in points scored between home and away wins for each team?"

To answer this question, multiple queries were written to aggregate home and away win points and average them to look at point differentials for each team. Finally, the project explores the differences in points per season between two specific teams, the Los Angeles Clippers and Los Angeles Lakers as a specific point of interest and way to demonstrate subquerying, joins, and good SQL formatting practices.
